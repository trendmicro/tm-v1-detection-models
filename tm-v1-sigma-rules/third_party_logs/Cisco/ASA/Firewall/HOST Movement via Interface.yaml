title: HOST Movement via Interface
description: A host move was detected from one module interface to another. In a transparent Secure Firewall ASA, mapping between the host (MAC) and Secure Firewall ASA port is maintained in a Layer 2 forwarding table. The table dynamically binds packet source MAC addresses to a Secure Firewall ASA port. In this process, whenever movement of a host from one interface to another interface is detected, this message is generated.
