title: Crypto Hardware Issue via Archive File
description: A functional problem with the hardware crypto chip was detected (see syslog messages 402124 and 402125). To further debug the crypto problem, a crypto archive file was generated that included the current crypto hardware environment (hardware registers and crypto description entries). At boot time, a crypto_archive directory was automatically created on the flash filesystem (if it did not exist previously).
