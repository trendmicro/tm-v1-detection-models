title: Potential Task Handling Issue via Unrecognized Timer Event
description: An unexpected timer event woke up the task, but the task does not know how to handle the event. A task can register a set of timer services with the scheduler. If any of the timers expire, the scheduler wakes up the task to take action. This message is generated if the task is awakened by an unrecognized timer event.
