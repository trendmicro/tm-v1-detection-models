title: ACL Deny via IP Packet
description: A real IP packet was denied by the ACL. This message appears even if you do not have the log option enabled for an ACL. The IP address is the real IP address instead of the values that display through NAT. Both user identity information and FQDN information are provided for the IP addresses if a matched one is found. The Secure Firewall ASA logs either identity information (domain\user) or FQDN (if the username is not available).
