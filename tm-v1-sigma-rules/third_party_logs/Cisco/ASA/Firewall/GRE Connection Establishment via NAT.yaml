title: GRE Connection Establishment via NAT
description: A GRE connection slot between two hosts was created. The ID is a unique identifier. The interface, real_address, real_cid tuple identifies one of the two simplex PPTP GRE streams. The parenthetical translated_address, translated_cid tuple identifies the translated value with NAT. If inbound is indicated, then the connection can only be used inbound.
