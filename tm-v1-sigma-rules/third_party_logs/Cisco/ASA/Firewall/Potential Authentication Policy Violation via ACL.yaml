title: Potential Authentication Policy Violation via ACL
description: The Secure Firewall ASA received an access control list from a RADIUS server to apply to a user connection, but an entry in the list contains a syntax error. The use of a list containing an error could result in the violation of a security policy, so the Secure Firewall ASA failed to authenticate the user.
