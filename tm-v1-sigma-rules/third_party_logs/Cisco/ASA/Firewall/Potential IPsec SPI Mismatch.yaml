title: Potential IPsec SPI Mismatch
description: An IPsec packet was received that specifies an SPI that does not exist in the SA database. This may be a temporary condition caused by slight differences in aging of SAs between the IPsec peers, or it may be because the local SAs have been cleared. It may also indicate incorrect packets sent by the IPsec peer, which may be part of an attack. This message is rate-limited to no more than one message every five seconds.
