title: Connection Reset via Web Traffic
description: The message appears under normal traffic conditions if there are internal users that are accessing the Internet through a web browser. Anytime a connection is reset, when the host at the end of the connection sends a packet after the Secure Firewall ASA receives the connection reset, this message appears. It can typically be ignored.
