title: Network Admin Unrestricted External Access
description: Detects when network administrators are granted unrestricted access to external networks or resources. This policy allows administrative accounts to communicate with any external destination, which could pose security risks if admin credentials are compromised or if overly permissive access is granted beyond operational requirements. Monitor for potential abuse or unauthorized external connections from privileged accounts.
