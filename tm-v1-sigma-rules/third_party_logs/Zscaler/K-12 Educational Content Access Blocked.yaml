title: K-12 Educational Content Access Blocked
description: Detects when access to K-12 educational websites, learning platforms, or academic resources has been blocked by security policies. This filter identifies potential overblocking of legitimate educational content that may impact student learning and academic activities. Medium severity blocking events require review to ensure educational access is not unnecessarily restricted while maintaining appropriate security controls.
