title: Blocked Access to Suspicious Destination
description: Detects when Zscaler blocks user attempts to access potentially malicious or suspicious destinations. This filter identifies blocked connections to domains, URLs, or IP addresses that may be associated with malware, phishing, command and control infrastructure, or other security threats. Monitoring these blocked attempts helps identify compromised endpoints, user behavior anomalies, and potential security incidents requiring investigation.
