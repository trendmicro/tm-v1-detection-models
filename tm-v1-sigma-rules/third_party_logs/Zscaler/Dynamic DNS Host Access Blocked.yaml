title: Dynamic DNS Host Access Blocked
description: Detects and blocks access attempts to dynamic DNS services that are commonly used by threat actors to host malicious infrastructure. Dynamic DNS providers allow attackers to rapidly change IP addresses associated with malicious domains, making detection and blocking more difficult. This filter helps prevent communication with potentially compromised or malicious hosts using dynamic DNS services.
