title: Newly Registered Domain Access Blocked
description: Detects blocked access attempts to newly registered or recently observed domains. These domains pose elevated security risks as they are commonly used in phishing campaigns, malware distribution, and other malicious activities before reputation systems can properly categorize them. Monitoring blocked access to such domains helps identify potential security threats and compromised endpoints attempting to communicate with suspicious infrastructure.
