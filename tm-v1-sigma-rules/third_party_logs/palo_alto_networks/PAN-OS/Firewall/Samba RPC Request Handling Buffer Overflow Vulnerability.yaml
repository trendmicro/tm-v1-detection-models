title: Samba RPC Request Handling Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Samba RPC Request Handling Buffer Overflow Vulnerability. Samba is prone to a heap overflow vulnerability while handling certain crafted RPC requests. The vulnerability is due to lack of boundary checks while performing specific RPC operations. Remote authenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted RPC request to various RPC interfaces. A successful exploit could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system in the context of the affected process.
