title: AWStats Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for AWStats Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. AWstats versions lower than 6.3 are prone to a remote code execution vulnerability due to the lack of input validation for certain request parameters. AWStats is an open source tool to generate advanced http, ftp, and mail server statistics graphically. The vulnerability is due to the lack validation checks when certain shell characters are supplied as input to certain parameters. An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilityby appending arbitrary commands to the shell character, which in turn is supplied as an argument. A successful attack might result in arbitrary code execution, with the privileges of the web server.
