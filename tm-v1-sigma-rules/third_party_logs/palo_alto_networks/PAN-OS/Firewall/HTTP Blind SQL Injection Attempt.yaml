title: HTTP Blind SQL Injection Attempt
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for HTTP Blind SQL Injection Attempt. SQL injection is a technique that exploits a security vulnerability occurring in the database layer of an application. The vulnerability is present when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and thereby unexpectedly executed. It is, in fact, an instance of a more general class of vulnerabilities that can occur whenever one programming or scripting language is embedded inside another.
