title: HTTP Apache Tomcat DefaultServlet File Disclosure Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for HTTP Apache Tomcat DefaultServlet File Disclosure Vulnerability. Apache Tomcat is prone to a file disclosure vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP request. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted URL request for a known JavaServer Pages (JSP) that invokes the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet class to bypass protection and obtain the source code of the requested JSP page. An attacker could then use this information to launch further attacks against the affected server.
