title: OpenSSL SM2 Decryption sm2plaintextsize Miscalculation Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for OpenSSL SM2 Decryption sm2plaintextsize Miscalculation Buffer Overflow Vulnerability. OpenSSL is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability while parsing certain crafted SM2 files. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on SM2 files, leading to an exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted SM2 file. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
