title: Microsoft IIS Unicode Canonicalization Directory Traversal Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Microsoft IIS Extended Unicode Improper Canonicalization Directory Traversal Vulnerability. Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) versions 4.0 and 5.0 are prone to a directory traversal vulnerability while parsing certain URLs which use Unicode character sets. The vulnerability is due to improper canonicalization causing certain URI paths to be decoded to directory traversal paths. This could be exploited by an attacker to access arbitrary directories and files on the IIS server. A successful attack could be used to read, or write documents outside of the web root, and possibly to execute arbitrary commands. This vulnerability has commonly been exploited by CodeBlue worm.
