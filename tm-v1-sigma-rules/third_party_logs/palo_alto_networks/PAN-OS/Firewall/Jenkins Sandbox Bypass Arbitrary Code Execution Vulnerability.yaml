title: Jenkins Sandbox Bypass Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Jenkins Sandbox Bypass Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability. Jenkins is prone to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on HTTP requests, leading to an exploitable arbitrary code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
