title: NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit nvdisasm Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit nvdisasm Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit nvdisasm is prone to a heap buffer overflow vulnerability while parsing certain crafted ELF files. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on ELF files, leading to an exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted ELF file. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the currently logged-in user.
