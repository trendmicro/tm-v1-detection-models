title: HTTP Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for HTTP Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability. This signature detects suspected attempts to locate and/or exploit cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in a web application. XSS vulnerabilities are created by a lack of proper checks on HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit XSS vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request that executes arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, leading to cookie theft and other data leakage. This signature specifically checks HTTP request parameters for an attempted JavaScript alert dialog box. This is commonly used to test URI query strings for JavaScript injection vulnerabilities.
