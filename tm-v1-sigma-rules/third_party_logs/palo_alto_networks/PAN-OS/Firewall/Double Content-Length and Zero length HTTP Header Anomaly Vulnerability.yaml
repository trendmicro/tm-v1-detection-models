title: Double Content-Length and Zero length HTTP Header Anomaly Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Double Content-Length and Zero length HTTP Header Anomaly Vulnerability. Several HTTP proxies including Squid proxy are prone to a HTTP request smuggling vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to the improper parsing of multiple headers such as multiple content length fields, or the presence of both content length and transfer encoding. Since there might be discrepancy between the HTTP proxy and server while parsing the headers, it could lead to poisoning the proxy cache. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request.
