title: Network Time Protocol Windows Daemon Denial of Service Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Network Time Protocol Windows Daemon Denial of Service Vulnerability. The Network Time Protocol Windows Daemon is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability while parsing certain crafted UDP requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on the size of UDP packets, leading to an exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an overly large UDP packet. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
