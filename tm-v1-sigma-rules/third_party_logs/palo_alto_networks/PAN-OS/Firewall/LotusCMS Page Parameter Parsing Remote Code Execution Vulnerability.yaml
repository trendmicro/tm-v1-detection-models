title: LotusCMS Page Parameter Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for LotusCMS Page Parameter Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. LotusCMS is prone to a remote code execution vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitisation of parameters passed to the router function in core/lib/router.php. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted page parameter to index.php in a HTTP request. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
