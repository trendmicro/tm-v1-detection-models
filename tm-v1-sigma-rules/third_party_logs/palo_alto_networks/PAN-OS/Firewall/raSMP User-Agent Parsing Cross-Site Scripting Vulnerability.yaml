title: raSMP User-Agent Parsing Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for raSMP User-Agent Parsing Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability. raSMP 2.0.0 and earlier is prone to a cross-site vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is present in index.php and is due to the lack of proper checks on User-Agent header in a request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request and thereby inject arbitrary web script via the User-Agent header. A successful attack could lead to script execution with the privileges of the server.
