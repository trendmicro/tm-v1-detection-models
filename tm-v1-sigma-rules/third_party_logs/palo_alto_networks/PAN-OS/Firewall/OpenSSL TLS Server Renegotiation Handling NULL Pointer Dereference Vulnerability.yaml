title: OpenSSL TLS Server Renegotiation Handling NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for OpenSSL TLS Server Renegotiation Handling NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability. OpenSSL TLS Server is prone to a null pointer dereference vulnerability while parsing certain crafted TLS requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on TLS requests, leading to an exploitable null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted TLS requests. A successful attack could lead to denial-of-service.
