title: Apache HTTP Server mod_log_config Null Cookie Denial of Service Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Apache HTTP Server mod_log_config Null Cookie Denial of Service Vulnerability. Apache HTTP Server is prone to a denial of service vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is present in mod_log_config and is due to the lack of proper checks on nameless, valueless cookies, which cause a segmentation fault while logging cookeis. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with null cookie. A successful attack could crash the server.
