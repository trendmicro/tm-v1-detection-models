title: GnuTLS Memory Access Error Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for GnuTLS Memory Access Error Vulnerability. GnuTLS is prone to a memory access error vulnerability while parsing certain crafted TLS responses. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on TLS responses, leading to an exploitable memory access error vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted TLS responses. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the currently logged-in user.
