title: Apple Safari URL Handling Cross-Origin Security Bypass Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Apple Safari URL Handling Cross-Origin Security Bypass Vulnerability. Apple Safari is prone to a cross-origin security bypass vulnerability while parsing certain crafted http responses. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on URLs in the HTTP response, leading to an exploitable cross-origin security bypass. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP response. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the current logged-in user.
