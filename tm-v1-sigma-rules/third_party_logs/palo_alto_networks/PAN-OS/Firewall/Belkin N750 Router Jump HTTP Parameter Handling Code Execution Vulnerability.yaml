title: Belkin N750 Router Jump HTTP Parameter Handling Code Execution Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Belkin N750 Router Jump HTTP Parameter Handling Code Execution Vulnerability. The Belkin N750 Router is prone to a code execution vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is present in MiniHttpd, due to the lack of proper checks on values passed to the jump parameter. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to execute arbitrary code. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
