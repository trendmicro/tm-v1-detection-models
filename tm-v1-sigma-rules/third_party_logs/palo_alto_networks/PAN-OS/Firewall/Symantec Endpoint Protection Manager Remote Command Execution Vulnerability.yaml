title: Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager Remote Command Execution Vulnerability. Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager versions 11.0, 12.0 and 12.1 are prone to a command execution vulnerability while parsing certain crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is because the manager does not properly handle XXE request, which could allow SQL injection. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to execute arbitrary commands, since xp_cmdshell is enabled. A successful attack could lead to remote command execution with the privileges of the manager server.
