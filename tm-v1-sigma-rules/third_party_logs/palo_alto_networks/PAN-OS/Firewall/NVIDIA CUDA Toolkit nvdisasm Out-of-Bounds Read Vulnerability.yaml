title: NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit nvdisasm Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit nvdisasm Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit nvdisasm is prone to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability while parsing certain crafted ELF files. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on ELF files, leading to an exploitable out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted ELF file. A successful attack could lead to information disclosure with the privileges of the currently logged-in user.
