title: Netgear Remote and Local Password Disclosure Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Netgear Remote and Local Password Disclosure Vulnerability. Netgear routers are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted request to the web management server. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on CGI script in the HTTP request, leading to an exploitable password disclosure. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful attack could lead to access to the router with the privileges of the server logged-in user.
