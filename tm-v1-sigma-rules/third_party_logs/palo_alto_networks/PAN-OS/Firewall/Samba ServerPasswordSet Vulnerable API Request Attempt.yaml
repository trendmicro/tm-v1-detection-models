title: Samba ServerPasswordSet Vulnerable API Request Attempt
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Samba ServerPasswordSet Vulnerable API Request Attempt. Samba smbd is prone to a memory corruption vulnerability while parsing certain crafted RPC messages. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks while parsing parameters passed to the ServerPasswordSet API to the NetLogon interface. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted NetLogon RPC message to the listening server. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
