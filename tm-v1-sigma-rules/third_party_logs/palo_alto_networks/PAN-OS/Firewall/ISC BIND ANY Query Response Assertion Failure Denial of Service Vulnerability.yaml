title: ISC BIND ANY Query Response Assertion Failure Denial of Service Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for ISC BIND ANY Query Response Assertion Failure Denial of Service Vulnerability. ISC BIND is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability while parsing certain crafted DNS responses. The vulnerability is due to a defect that can cause named service to exit with an assertion failure while processing a crafted DNS response packet for an ANY query. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted response to the vulnerable server. Successful exploitation could lead to denial-of-service condition.
