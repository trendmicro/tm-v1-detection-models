title: Novell Client NWSPOOL.DLL Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for Novell Client NWSPOOL.DLL Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability. Novell Netware Client 4.91 through 4.91 SP2 are prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability while parsing certain crafted RPC requests. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper checks on parameters passed to the OpenPrinter function in the RPC request, leading to an exploitable buffer overflow. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted RPC request to the server overflowing finite buffers. A successful attack could lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the server.
