title: OpenSSL Handshake Cipher Two More Times Changed Anomaly
description: Palo Alto Networks detection for OpenSSL Handshake Cipher Two More Times Changed Anomaly. Many software and hardware products use the OpenSSL library for SSL/TLS support. These include all Cisco products, Nortel/Alteon products, Juniper products, the Apache web server, and a very large number of other hardware and software products. A vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL library's handling of ChangeCipherSpec messages within the SSL protocol. This vulnerability may allow remote attackers to cause applications using OpenSSL to terminate.
