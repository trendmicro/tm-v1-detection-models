title: Suspicious OneNote Process Chain Activity via Microsoft Telemetry
description: Microsoft telemetry detection that identifies OneNote spawning mshta.exe,
  which in turn attempts to execute or download content using curl.exe. This behavior
  is consistent with malicious document-based delivery techniques where threat actors
  embed scripts or payload downloaders inside OneNote files.
